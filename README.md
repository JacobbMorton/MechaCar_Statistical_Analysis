## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The variables and coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variances were the Intercept, ground clearance and the mpg. 

The slope of the linear model is never considered to be zero because the calculated scope from vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle etc. is never 0

The linear model predicts the mpg of the mechacar prototypes effectively because the Multiple R-squared value is closer to 1 with a value of .71.

The current manufacturing data for each lot individually does not completely meet design specifications as shown in lot 3. The Variance is well over the tolerance of 100.
As a whole though, the data meets the design specifications as the average of the three lots is less than 100.
