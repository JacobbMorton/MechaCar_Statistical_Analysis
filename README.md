## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The variables and coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variances were the Intercept, ground clearance and the mpg. 

The slope of the linear model is never considered to be zero because the calculated scope from vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle etc. is never 0

The linear model predicts the mpg of the mechacar prototypes effectively because the Multiple R-squared value is closer to 1 with a value of .71.
